<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>This sample post teaches you my preferred approach for authoring new posts that need to execute R code. The post includes a table of contents and code highlighting. The post content covers interactive HTML tables via the <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/DT/">DT</a> package, static graphs via the <a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/">ggplot2</a> package, and interactive plots via the <a href="https://plotly.com/r/">plotly</a> package.</p>
